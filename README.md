# macscript
General script for installing palera1n/checkra1n and bootstrapping Procursus/APT on macOS

its on [my cdn](https://cdn.planks.ml/scripts/macscript.sh) too

still NOT finished!

here's a oneliner

`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL -k https://cdn.planks.ml/scripts/macscript.sh)"`

Credits to azaz for the fix for APT on macOS and for the iPhone palera1n installation part
